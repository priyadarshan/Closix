<P><I>status</I> -- A fixnum.</P>

<H3>Description</H3>

  <P>
    The function <tt>exit</tt> terminates the calling process
    "immediately".  Any open file descriptors belonging to the process
    are closed; any children of the process are inherited by process
    1, init, and the process's parent is sent a SIGCHLD signal.
  </P>

  <P>
    The value status is returned to the parent process as the
    process's exit status, and can be collected using one of the
    <tt>wait</tt> family of calls.
  </P>
