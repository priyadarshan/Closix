<P><B>Syntax:</B></P>

<P><B>write</B> <I>file-descriptor</I> <I>vector</I>
  <TT>&amp;key</TT>(<I>start</I> <TT>0</TT>) (<I>end</I> <TT>nil</TT>)

<P><B>Arguments and values:</B></P>

<P><I>file-descriptor</I> -- A non-negative integer.</P>

<P><I>vector</I> -- A vector with element-type <TT>(unsigned-byte 8)</TT>.

<P><I>effective-count</I> -- A non-negative integer.</P>

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<P>
  <B>write</B> writes up to count bytes from the interval
  in <I>vector</I> designated by <I>start</I> and <I>end</I> to
  the file referred to by <I>file-descriptor</I>.
</P>

<P>
  The number of bytes written may be less than count if, for example,
  there is insufficient space on the underlying physical medium, or
  the <a href="rlimit-fsize.html">+rlimit-fsize+</a> resource limit is
  encountered (see <a href="setrlimit.html">setrlimit</a>), or the
  call was interrupted by a signal handler after having written less
  than count bytes.
</P>

<P>
  For a seekable file (i.e., one to
  which <a href="lseek.html">lseek</a> may be applied, for example, a
  regular file) writing takes place at the current file offset, and
  the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes actually
  written.  If the file was open(2)ed with O_APPEND, the file offset
  is first set to the end of the file before writing.  The adjustment
  of the file offset and the write operation are performed as an
  atomic step.
</P>

<P>
  POSIX requires that a <a href="read.html">read</a> which can be
  proved to occur after a <B>write</B> has returned returns the new
  data.  Note that not all file systems are POSIX conforming.
</P>

<P><B>Errors:</B></P>

  <P>If <I>file-descriptor</I> is not a valid file descriptor, or not
    open for writing, the
    condition <a href="invalid-file-descriptor.html">invalid-file-descriptor</a>
    is signaled.
    </P>
