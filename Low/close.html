<H2><I>Function</I> CLOSE</H2>

<H3>Syntax</H3>

<P><B>close</B> <I>file-descriptor</I> =&gt; <I>error</I></P>

<H3>Arguments and values</H3>

<P><I>file-descriptor</I> -- A non-negative fixnum.</P>

<P><I>error</I> -- A fixnum.</P>

<H3>Description</H3>

  <P>
    <TT>close</tt> closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer
    refers to any file and may be reused.  Any record locks (see
    <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a>) held on the file it was associated
    with, and owned by the process, are removed (regardless of the
    file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock).
  </P>

  <P>
    If <I>file-descriptor</I> is the last file descriptor referring to
    the underlying open file description
    (see <a href="open.html">open</a>), the resources associated with
    the open file description are freed; if the descriptor was the
    last reference to a file which has been removed
    using <a href="unlink.html">unlink</a> the file is deleted.
  </P>

<H3>Errors</H3>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="ebadf.html">+ebadf+</a></td>

      <I>file-descriptor</I> is not a valid open file descriptor.

    <td>
      The <TT>close</TT> call was interrupted by a signal; see
      signal(7).

<H3>Notes</H3>

<P>
  Not checking the return value of <TT>close</TT> is a common but
  nevertheless serious programming error.  It is quite possible that
  errors on a previous <a href="write.html">write</a> operation are
  first reported at the final <TT>close</TT>.  Not checking the return
  value when closing the file may lead to silent loss of data.  This
  can especially be observed with NFS and with disk quota.
</P>

<P>
  A successful close does not guarantee that the data has been
  successfully saved to disk, as the kernel defers writes.  It is not
  common for a file system to flush the buffers when the stream is
  closed.  If you need to be sure that the data is physically stored
  use <a href="fsync.html">fsync</a>.  (It will depend on the disk
  hardware at this point.)
</P>

<P>
  It is probably unwise to close file descriptors while they may be in
  use by system calls in other threads in the same process.  Since a
  file descriptor may be reused, there are some obscure race
  conditions that may cause unintended side effects.
</P>
