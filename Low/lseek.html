<H3>Arguments and values</H3>

<P><I>file-descriptor</I> -- A non-negative fixnum.</P>

<P><I>offset</I> -- An integer.</P>

<P><I>error</I> -- A fixnum. </P>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P>
  This function repositions the offset of the open file associated
  with the file descriptor <I>file-descriptor</I> to the argument
  <I>offset</I> according to the directive <I>whence</I> as follows:
</P>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="seek-set.html">+seek-set+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	The offset is set to <I>offset</I> bytes.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="seek-cur.html">+seek-cur+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	The offset is set to its current location plus <I>offset</I>
	bytes.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="seek-end.html">+seek-end+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	The offset is set to the size of the file plus <I>offset</I>
	bytes.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="seek-data.html">+seek-data+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	Adjust the file offset to the next location in the file
        greater than or equal to <I>offset</I> containing data.  If
        <I>offset</I> points to data, then the file offset is set to
        <I>offset</I>.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="seek-hole.html">+seek-hole+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	Adjust the file offset to the next hole in the file greater
	than or equal to <I>offset</I>.  If <I>offset</I> points into
	the middle of a hole, then the file offset is set
	to <I>offset</I>.  If there is no hole past <I>offset</I>,
	then the file offset is adjusted to the end of the file (i.e.,
	there is an implicit hole at the end of any file).
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<P>
  In both of the above cases, the call fails if <I>offset</I> points
  past the end of the file.
</P>

<P>
  These operations allow applications to map holes in a sparsely
  allocated file.  This can be useful for applications such as file
  backup tools, which can save space when creating backups and
  preserve holes, if they have a mechanism for discovering holes.
</P>

<P>
  For the purposes of these operations, a hole is a sequence of zeros
  that (normally) has not been allocated in the underlying file
  storage.  However, a filesystem is not obliged to report holes, so
  these operations are not a guaranteed mechanism for mapping the
  storage space actually allocated to a file.  (Furthermore, a
  sequence of zeros that actually has been written to the underlying
  storage may not be reported as a hole.)  In the simplest
  implementation, a filesystem can support the operations by making
  <tt>+seek-hole+</tt> always return the offset of the end of the
  file, and making <tt>+seek-data+</tt> always return <I>offset</I>
  (i.e., even if the location referred to by <I>offset</I> is a hole,
  it can be considered to consist of data that is a sequence of
  zeros).

    <td><I>whence</I> is <TT>+seek-data+</TT> or <TT>+seek-hole+</TT>,

<H3>Notes</H3>

<P>
  Some devices are incapable of seeking and POSIX does not specify
  which devices must support this system call.
</P>

<P>
  On Linux, using this call on a terminal device
  returns <TT>+espipe+</TT>.
</P>

<P>
  Note that file descriptors created by <a href="dup.html">dup</a> or
  <a href="fork.html">fork</a> share the current file position
  pointer, so seeking on such files may be subject to race conditions.
