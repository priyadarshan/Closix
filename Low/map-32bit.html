<P>
  (since Linux 2.4.20, 2.6) Put the mapping into the first 2 Gigabytes
  of the process address space.  This flag is only supported on
  x86-64, for 64-bit programs.  It was added to allow thread stacks to
  be allocated somewhere in the first 2GB of memory, so as to improve
  context-switch performance on some early 64-bit processors. Modern
  x86-64 processors no longer have this performance problem, so use of
  this flag is not required on those systems.
  The <tt>+map-32bit+</tt> flag is ignored
  when <a href="map-fixed.html">+map-fixed+</a> is set.
