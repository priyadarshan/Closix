<A NAME="+map-anonymous+"><I>Constant variable</I> <B>+MAP-ANONYMOUS+</B></A>
<P>
  The mapping is not backed by any file; its contents are initialized
  to zero.  The fd and offset arguments are ignored; however, some
  implementations require fd to be -1 if <tt>+map-anonymous</tt> (or
  <a href="map-anon.html">+map-anon+</a>) is specified, and portable
  applications should ensure this.  The use of <tt>+map-anonymous</tt>
  in conjunction with <a href="map-shared.html">+map-shared+</a> is
  only supported on Linux since kernel 2.4.
