  Do not interpret addr as a hint: place the mapping at exactly that
  address.  addr must be a multiple of the page size.  If the memory
  region specified by addr and len overlaps pages of any existing
  mapping(s), then the overlapped part of the existing mapping(s) will
  be discarded.  If the specified address cannot be used, mmap() will
  fail.  Because requiring a fixed address for a mapping is less
  portable, the use of this option is discouraged.
