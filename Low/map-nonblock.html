<A NAME="+map-nonblock+"><I>Constant variable</I> <B>+MAP-NONBLOCK+</B></A>
<P>
  (since Linux 2.5.46) Only meaningful in conjunction with
  <a href="map-populate.html">+map-populate+</a>.  Don't perform
  read-ahead: only create page tables entries for pages that are
  already present in RAM. Since Linux 2.6.23, this flag
  causes <a href="map-populate.html">+map-populate+</a> to do nothing.
  One day the combination
  of <a href="map-populate.html">+map-populate+</a>
  and <tt>+map-nonblock+</tt> may be reimplemented.
