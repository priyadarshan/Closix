<P>
  Do not reserve swap space for this mapping.  When swap space is
  reserved, one has the guarantee that it is possible to modify the
  mapping.  When swap space is not reserved one might get SIGSEGV upon
  a write if no physical memory is available.  See also the discussion
  of the file /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory in proc(5).  In kernels
  before 2.6, this flag only had effect for private writable mappings.
