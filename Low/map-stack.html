<P>
  (since Linux 2.6.27) Allocate the mapping at an address suitable for
  a process or thread stack.  This flag is currently a no-op, but is
  used in the glibc threading implementation so that if some
  architectures require special treatment for stack allocations,
  support can later be transparently implemented for glibc.
