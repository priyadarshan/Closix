  (since Linux 2.6.33) Don't clear anonymous pages.  This flag is
  intended to improve performance on embedded devices.  This flag is
  only honored if the kernel was configured with the
  CONFIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED option.  Because of the security
  implications, that option is normally enabled only on embedded
  devices (i.e., devices where one has complete control of the
  contents of user memory).
