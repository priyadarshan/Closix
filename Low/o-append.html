<P>
  The file is opened in append mode.  Before
  each <a href="write.html">write</a>, the file offset is positioned
  at the end of the file, as if with <a href="lseek.html">lseek</a>.
  <tt>+o-append+</tt> may lead to corrupted files on NFS file systems
  if more than one process appends data to a file at once.  This is
  because NFS does not support appending to a file, so the client
  kernel has to simulate it, which can't be done without a race
  condition.
