  If the file does not exist it will be created.  The owner (user ID)
  of the file is set to the effective user ID of the process.  The
  group ownership (group ID) is set either to the effective group ID
  of the process or to the group ID of the parent directory (depending
  on file system type and mount options, and the mode of the parent
  directory, see the mount options bsdgroups and sysvgroups described
  in mount(8)).
