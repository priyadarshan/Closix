<P>
  (Since Linux 2.4.10) Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and
  from this file.  In general this will degrade performance, but it is
  useful in special situations, such as when applications do their own
  caching.  File I/O is done directly to/from user space buffers.  The
  <tt>+o-direct+</tt> flag on its own makes an effort to transfer data
  synchronously, but does not give the guarantees of
  the <a href="o-sync.html">+o-sync+</a> flag that data and necessary
  metadata are transferred.  To guarantee synchronous
  I/O, <a href="o-sync.html">+o-sync+</a> must be used in addition
  to <tt>+o-direct+</tt>.  See NOTES below for further discussion.

<P>
  A semantically similar (but deprecated) interface for block devices
  is described in raw(8).
