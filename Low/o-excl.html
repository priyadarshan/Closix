<P>
  Ensure that this call creates the file: if this flag is specified in
  conjunction with <a href="o-creat.html">+o-creat+</a>, and pathname
  already exists, then <a href="open.html">open</a> will fail.
</P>

<P>
  When these two flags are specified, symbolic links are not followed:
  if pathname is a symbolic link, then <a href="open.html">open</a>
  fails regardless of where the symbolic link points to.
</P>

<P>
  In general, the behavior of <tt>+o-excl+</tt> is undefined if it is
  used without <a href="o-creat.html">+o-creat+</a>.  There is one
  exception: on Linux 2.6 and later, <tt>+o-excl+</tt> can be used
  without <a href="o-creat.html">+o-creat+</a> if pathname refers to a
  block device.  If the block device is in use by the system (e.g.,
  mounted), <a href="open.html">open</a> fails with the
  error <a href="ebusy.html">+ebusy+</a>.
</P>

<P>
  On NFS, <tt>+o-excl+</tt> is only supported when using NFSv3 or
  later on kernel 2.6 or later.  In NFS environments
  where <tt>+o-excl+</tt> support is not provided, programs that rely
  on it for performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.
  Portable programs that want to perform atomic file locking using a
  lockfile, and need to avoid reliance on NFS support
  for <tt>+o-excl+</tt>, can create a unique file on the same file
  system (e.g., incorporating hostname and PID), and
  use <a href="link.html">link</a> to make a link to the lockfile.
  If <a href="link.html">link</a> returns 0, the lock is successful.
  Otherwise, use <a href="stat.html">stat</a> on the unique file to
  check if its link count has increased to 2, in which case the lock
  is also successful.
