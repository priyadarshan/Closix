<P>
  (LFS) Allow files whose sizes cannot be represented in an off_t (but
  can be represented in an off64_t) to be opened.  The
  _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE macro must be defined (before including any
  header files) in order to obtain this definition.  Setting the
  _FILE_OFFSET_BITS feature test macro to 64 (rather than using
  <tt>+o-largefile+</tt>) is the preferred method of accessing large
  files on 32-bit systems (see feature_test_macros(7)).
