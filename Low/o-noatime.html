<P>
  (Since Linux 2.6.8) Do not update the file last access time
  (st_atime in the inode) when the file
  is <a href="read.html">read</a>.  This flag is intended for use by
  indexing or backup programs, where its use can significantly reduce
  the amount of disk activity.  This flag may not be effective on all
  file systems.  One example is NFS, where the server maintains the
  access time.
