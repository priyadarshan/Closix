  When possible, the file is opened in nonblocking mode.  Neither the
  <a href="open.html">open</a> nor any subsequent operations on the
  file descriptor which is returned will cause the calling process to
  wait.  For the handling of FIFOs (named pipes), see also fifo(7).
  For a discussion of the effect of <tt>+o-nonblock+</tt> in
  conjunction with mandatory file locks and with file leases,
