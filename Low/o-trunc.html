<P>
  If the file already exists and is a regular file and the open mode
  allows writing (i.e., is <a href="o-rdwr.html">+o-rdwr+</a> or
  <a href="o-wronly.html">+o-wronly+</a>) it will be truncated to
  length 0.  If the file is a FIFO or terminal device file, the
  <tt>+o-trunc+</tt> flag is ignored.  Otherwise the effect
  of <tt>+o-trunc+</tt> is unspecified.
