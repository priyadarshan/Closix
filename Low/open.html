<H3>Description</H3>


<P>
  Given a pathname for a file, open() returns a file descriptor, a
  small, nonnegative integer for use in subsequent system calls
  (read(2), write(2), lseek(2), fcntl(2), etc.).  The file descriptor
  returned by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file
  descriptor not currently open for the process.
</P>

<P>
  By default, the new file descriptor is set to remain open across an
  execve(2) (i.e., the FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag described in
  fcntl(2) is initially disabled; the O_CLOEXEC flag, described below,
  can be used to change this default).  The file offset is set to the
  beginning of the file (see lseek(2)).
</P>

<P>
  A call to open() creates a new open file description, an entry in
  the system-wide table of open files.  This entry records the file
  offset and the file status flags (modifiable via the fcntl(2)
  F_SETFL operation).  A file descriptor is a reference to one of
  these entries; this reference is unaffected if pathname is
  subsequently removed or modified to refer to a different file.  The
  new open file description is initially not shared with any other
  process, but sharing may arise via fork(2).
</P>

<P>
  The argument flags must include one of the following access modes:
  O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR.  These request opening the file
  read-only, write-only, or read/write, respectively.
</P>

<P>
  In  addition,  zero  or  more file creation flags and file status
  flags can be bitwise-or'd in flags.  The file creation flags are
  O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_NOCTTY, and O_TRUNC.  The file status flags are
  all of the remaining flags listed below.  The distinction between
  these two groups of flags is that the file status flags can be
  retrieved and (in some cases) modified using fcntl(2).  The full
  list of file creation flags and file status flags is as follows:

	The file is opened in append mode.  Before
	each <a href="write.html">write</a>, the file offset is
	positioned at the end of the file, as if
	with <a href="lseek.html">lseek</a>.
	<tt>+o-append+</tt> may lead to corrupted files on NFS file
	systems if more than one process appends data to a file at
	once.  This is because NFS does not support appending to a
	file, so the client kernel has to simulate it, which can't be
	done without a race condition.

	(Since Linux 2.6.23) Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new

	avoid additional <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a> F_SETFD
	operations to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag.  Additionally, use of
	this flag is essential in some multithreaded programs since
	using a separate <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a> F_SETFD
	operation to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag does not suffice to avoid
	race conditions where one thread opens a file descriptor at

	If the file does not exist it will be created.  The owner (user ID)
	of the file is set to the effective user ID of the process.  The
	group ownership (group ID) is set either to the effective group ID
	of the process or to the group ID of the parent directory (depending
	on file system type and mount options, and the mode of the parent
	directory, see the mount options bsdgroups and sysvgroups described
	in mount(8)).
      </P>
      <P>
        mode specifies the permissions to use in case a new file is
        created.  This argument must be supplied when O_CREAT is
        specified in flags; if O_CREAT is not specified, then mode is
        ignored.  The effective permissions are modified by the
        process's umask in the usual way: The permissions of the
        created file are (mode & ~umask).  Note that this mode only
        applies to future accesses of the newly created file; the
        open() call that creates a read-only file may well return a
        read/write file descriptor.

	(Since Linux 2.4.10) Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and

	useful in special situations, such as when applications do their own
	caching.  File I/O is done directly to/from user space buffers.  The

	I/O, <a href="o-sync.html">+o-sync+</a> must be used in

	In general, the behavior of <tt>+o-excl+</tt> is undefined if
	it is used without <a href="o-creat.html">+o-creat+</a>.
	There is one exception: on Linux 2.6 and
	later, <tt>+o-excl+</tt> can be used
	without <a href="o-creat.html">+o-creat+</a> if pathname
	refers to a block device.  If the block device is in use by
	the system (e.g., mounted), <a href="open.html">open</a> fails

      </P>

      <P>
	On NFS, <tt>+o-excl+</tt> is only supported when using NFSv3
	or later on kernel 2.6 or later.  In NFS environments
	where <tt>+o-excl+</tt> support is not provided, programs that
	rely on it for performing locking tasks will contain a race
	condition.  Portable programs that want to perform atomic file
	locking using a lockfile, and need to avoid reliance on NFS
	support for <tt>+o-excl+</tt>, can create a unique file on the
	same file system (e.g., incorporating hostname and PID), and
	use <a href="link.html">link</a> to make a link to the
	lockfile.  If <a href="link.html">link</a> returns 0, the lock
	is successful.  Otherwise, use <a href="stat.html">stat</a> on
	the unique file to check if its link count has increased to 2,
	in which case the lock is also successful.
