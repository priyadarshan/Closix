<H3>Description</H3>


<P>
  Given a pathname for a file, <tt>open</tt> returns a file descriptor, a
  small, nonnegative integer for use in subsequent system calls
  (<a href="read.html">read</a>, <a href="write.html">write</a>, <a href="lseek.html">lseek</a>,
  <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a>, etc.).  The file descriptor returned
  by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not
  currently open for the process.
</P>

<P>
  By default, the new file descriptor is set to remain open across an
  <a href="execve.html">execve</a> (i.e., the FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag described in
  <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a> is initially disabled;
  the <a href="o-cloexec.html">+o-cloexec+</a> flag, described below,
  can be used to change this default).  The file offset is set to the
  beginning of the file (see <a href="lseek.html">lseek</a>).
</P>

<P>
  A call to <tt>open</tt> creates a new open file description, an entry in
  the system-wide table of open files.  This entry records the file
  offset and the file status flags (modifiable via the <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a>
  F_SETFL operation).  A file descriptor is a reference to one of
  these entries; this reference is unaffected if pathname is
  subsequently removed or modified to refer to a different file.  The
  new open file description is initially not shared with any other
  process, but sharing may arise via <a href="fork.html">fork</a>.
</P>

<P>
  The argument flags must include one of the following access modes:
  <a href="o-rdonly.html">+o-rdonly+</a>, 
  <a href="o-wronly.html">+o-wronly+</a>, or
  <a href="o-rdwr.html">+o-rdwr+</a>.  These request opening the file
  read-only, write-only, or read/write, respectively.
</P>

<P>
  In  addition,  zero  or  more file creation flags and file status
  flags can be bitwise-or'd in flags.  The file creation flags are
  <a href="o-creat.html">+o-creat+</a>, 
  <a href="o-excl.html">+o-excl+</a>, 
  <a href="o-noctty.html">+o-noctty+</a>, and
  <a href="o-trunc.html">+o-trunc+</a>.  The file status flags are all
  of the remaining flags listed below.  The distinction between these
  two groups of flags is that the file status flags can be retrieved
  and (in some cases) modified using <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a>.  The full list of file
  creation flags and file status flags is as follows:
</P>

<table border="1">

    <td><a href="o-append.html">+o-append+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	The file is opened in append mode.  Before
	each <a href="write.html">write</a>, the file offset is
	positioned at the end of the file, as if
	with <a href="lseek.html">lseek</a>.
	<tt>+o-append+</tt> may lead to corrupted files on NFS file
	systems if more than one process appends data to a file at
	once.  This is because NFS does not support appending to a
	file, so the client kernel has to simulate it, which can't be
	done without a race condition.

	operations to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag.  Additionally, use of
	this flag is essential in some multithreaded programs since
	using a separate <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a> F_SETFD
	operation to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag does not suffice to avoid
	race conditions where one thread opens a file descriptor at

        flags; if <a href="o-creat.html">+o-creat+</a> is not
        specified, then mode is ignored.  The effective permissions
        are modified by the process's umask in the usual way: The
        permissions of the created file are (mode & ~umask).  Note
        that this mode only applies to future accesses of the newly
        created file; the
        <tt>open</tt> call that creates a read-only file may well return a
        read/write file descriptor.

	without <a href="o-creat.html">+o-creat+</a> if pathname
	refers to a block device.  If the block device is in use by

      <P>
	On NFS, <tt>+o-excl+</tt> is only supported when using NFSv3

	rely on it for performing locking tasks will contain a race
	condition.  Portable programs that want to perform atomic file
	locking using a lockfile, and need to avoid reliance on NFS
	support for <tt>+o-excl+</tt>, can create a unique file on the
	same file system (e.g., incorporating hostname and PID), and
	use <a href="link.html">link</a> to make a link to the
	lockfile.  If <a href="link.html">link</a> returns 0, the lock
	is successful.  Otherwise, use <a href="stat.html">stat</a> on
	the unique file to check if its link count has increased to 2,
	in which case the lock is also successful.

<H3>Notes</H3>

<P>
Under Linux, the <a href="o-nonblock.html">+o-nonblock+</a> flag
indicates that one wants to open but does not necessarily have the
intention to read or write.  This is typically used to open devices in
order to get a file descriptor for use
with <a href="ioctl.html">ioctl</a>.
</P>

<P>
Unlike the other values that can be specified in flags, the access
mode
values <a href="o-rdonly.html">+o-rdonly+</a>, <a href="o-wronly.html">+o-wronly+</a>,
and <a href="o-rdwr.html">+o-rdwr+</a>, do not specify individual bits.  Rather, they define the
low order two bits of flags, and are defined respectively as 0, 1, and
2.  In other words, the combination
<a href="o-rdonly.html">+o-rdonly+</a>
| <a href="o-wronly.html">+o-wronly+</a> is a logical error, and
certainly does not have the same meaning
as <a href="o-rdwr.html">+o-rdwr+</a>.  Linux reserves the special,
nonstandard access mode 3 (binary 11) in flags to mean: check for read
and write permission on the file and return a descriptor that can't be
used for reading or writing.  This nonstandard access mode is used by
some Linux drivers to return a descriptor that is only to be used for
device-specific <a href="ioctl.html">ioctl</a> operations.

The (undefined) effect of <a href="o-rdonly.html">+o-rdonly+</a> | <a href="o-trunc.html">+o-trunc+</a> varies among
implementations.  On many systems the file is actually truncated.
</P>

<P>
There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS, affecting
amongst others <a href="o-sync.html">+o-sync+</a> and <a href="o-ndelay.html">+o-ndelay+</a>.
</P>

<P>
POSIX provides for three different variants of synchronized I/O,
corresponding to the flags <a href="o-sync.html">+o-sync+</a>,
<a href="o-dsync.html">+o-dsync+</a>,
and <a href="o-rsync.html">+o-rsync+</a>.  Currently (2.6.31), Linux
only implements <a href="o-sync.html">+o-sync+</a>, but glibc
maps <a href="o-dsync.html">+o-dsync+</a>
and <a href="o-rsync.html">+o-rsync+</a> to the same numerical value
as <a href="o-sync.html">+o-sync+</a>.  Most Linux file systems don't
actually implement the POSIX <a href="o-sync.html">+o-sync+</a>
semantics, which require all metadata updates of a write to be on disk
on returning to user space, but only
the <a href="o-dsync.html">+o-dsync+</a> semantics, which require only
actual file data and metadata necessary to retrieve it to be on disk
by the time the system call returns.
</P>

<P>
Note that <tt>open</tt> can open device special files, but creat() cannot
create them; use <a href="mknod.html">mknod</a> instead.

<P>
On NFS file systems with UID mapping enabled, <tt>open</tt> may return a file
descriptor but, for example, <a href="read.html">read</a> requests are denied with EACCES.
This is because the client performs <tt>open</tt> by checking the
permissions, but UID mapping is performed by the server upon read and
write requests.
</P>

<P>
If  the file is newly created, its st_atime, st_ctime, st_mtime fields
(respectively, time of last access, time of last status change, and
time of last modification; see <a href="stat.html">stat</a>) are set to the current time,
and so are the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the parent directory.
Otherwise, if the file is modified  because of the <a href="o-trunc.html">+o-trunc+</a> flag, its
st_ctime and st_mtime fields are set to the current time. 
</P>

<P>
The <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> flag may impose alignment restrictions on the length and
address of user-space buffers and the file offset of I/Os.  In Linux
alignment restrictions vary by file system and kernel version and
might be absent entirely.  However there is currently no file
system-independent interface for an application to discover these
restrictions for a given file or file system.  Some file systems
provide their own interfaces for doing so, for example the
XFS_IOC_DIOINFO operation in xfsctl(3).
</P>

<P>
Under Linux 2.4, transfer sizes, and the alignment of the user buffer
and the file offset must all be multiples of the logical block size of
the file system. Under Linux 2.6, alignment to 512-byte boundaries
suffices.
</P>

<P>
<a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> I/Os should never be run concurrently with the <a href="fork.html">fork</a> system
call, if the memory buffer is a private mapping (i.e., any mapping
created with the <a href="mmap.html">mmap</a> MAP_PRIVATE flag; this includes memory
allocated on the heap and statically allocated buffers).  Any such
I/Os, whether submitted via an asynchronous I/O interface or from
another thread in the process, should be completed before <a href="fork.html">fork</a> is
called.  Failure to do so can result in data corruption and undefined
behavior in parent and child processes.  This restriction does not
apply when the memory buffer for the <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> I/Os was created using
<a href="shmat.html">shmat</a> or <a href="mmap.html">mmap</a> with the MAP_SHARED flag.  Nor does this
restriction apply when the memory buffer has been advised as
MADV_DONTFORK with <a href="madvise.html">madvise</a>, ensuring that it will not be available
to the child after <a href="fork.html">fork</a>.
</P>

<P>
The <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> flag was introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment
restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4.  IRIX has also
a <a href="fcntl.html">fcntl</a> call to query appropriate alignments,
and sizes.  FreeBSD 4.x introduced a flag of the same name, but
without alignment restrictions.
</P>

<P>
<a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> support was added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10.
Older Linux kernels simply ignore this flag.  Some file systems may
not implement the flag and <tt>open</tt> will fail with EINVAL if it
is used.
</P>

<P>
Applications should avoid mixing <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> and normal I/O to the same
file, and especially to overlapping byte regions in the same file.
Even when the file system correctly handles the coherency issues in
this situation, overall I/O throughput is likely to be slower than
using either mode alone.  Likewise, applications should avoid mixing
<a href="mmap.html">mmap</a> of files with direct I/O to the same files.
</P>

<P>
 The behaviour of <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> with NFS will differ from local file
 systems.  Older kernels, or kernels configured in certain ways, may
 not support this combination. The NFS protocol does not support
 passing the flag to the server, so <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> I/O will only bypass the
 page cache on the client; the server may still cache the I/O.  The
 client asks the server to make the I/O synchronous to preserve the
 synchronous semantics of <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a>.  Some servers will perform poorly
 under these circumstances, especially if the I/O size is small.  Some
 servers may also be configured to lie to clients about the I/O having
 reached stable storage; this will avoid the performance penalty at
 some risk to data integrity in the event of server power failure.
 The Linux NFS client places no alignment restrictions on <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a>
 I/O.
</P>

<P>
In summary, <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> is a potentially powerful tool that should be
used with caution.  It is recommended that applications treat use of
<a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> as a performance option which is disabled by default.
