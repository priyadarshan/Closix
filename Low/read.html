<H3>Arguments and values</H3>

<P><I>file-descriptor</I> -- A non-negative fixnum.</P>

<P><I>vector</I> -- A vector with element-type <TT>(unsigned-byte 8)</TT>.

<H3>Description</H3>

  <P>
    The function <TT>read</TT> attempts to read up to <I>end -
    start</I> bytes from the file descriptor <I>file-descriptor</I>,
    filling the corresponding indices in <I>vector</I> with the bytes
    read.
  </P>

      <I>file-descriptor</I> refers to a file other than a socket and
      has been marked nonblocking
      (<a href="o-nonblock.html">+o-nonblock+</a>), and the read would
      block.

      <I>file-descriptor</I> refers to a socket and has been marked
      nonblocking (<a href="o-nonblock.html">+o-nonblock+</a>), and
      the read would block.  POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be
      returned for this case, and does not require these constants to
      have the same value, so a portable application should check for
      both possibilities.

      the <a href="o-direct.html">+o-direct+</a> flag, and either the

      I/O error.  This will happen for example when the process is in
      a background process group, tries to read from its controlling
      tty, and either it is ignoring or blocking SIGTTIN or its
      process group is orphaned.  It may also occur when there is a
      low-level I/O error while reading from a disk or tape.

<P>
  Other errors may occur, depending on the object connected
  to <I>file-descriptor</I>.  POSIX allows a <tt>read</tt> that is
  interrupted after reading some data to return -1 (with errno set to
  <a href="eintr.html">+eintr+</a>) or to return the number of bytes
  already read.
