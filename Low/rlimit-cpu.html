  CPU time limit in seconds.  When the process reaches the soft limit,
  it is sent a SIGXCPU signal.  The default action for this signal is
  to terminate the process.  However, the signal can be caught, and
  the handler can return control to the main program.  If the process
  continues to consume CPU time, it will be sent SIGXCPU once per
  second until the hard limit is reached, at which time it is sent
  SIGKILL.  (This latter point describes Linux behavior.
  Implementations vary in how they treat processes which continue to
  consume CPU time after reaching the soft limit.  Portable
  applications that need to catch this signal should perform an
  orderly termination upon first receipt of SIGXCPU.)
