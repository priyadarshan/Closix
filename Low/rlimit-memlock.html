<P>
  The maximum number of bytes of memory that may be locked into RAM.
  In effect this limit is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the
  system page size.  This limit affects <a href="mlock.html">mlock</a>
  and <a href="mlockall.html">mlockall</a> and
  the <a href="mmap.html">mmap</a> MAP_LOCKED operation.  Since Linux
  2.6.9 it also affects the <a href="shmctl.html">shmctl</a> SHM_LOCK
  operation, where it sets a maximum on the total bytes in shared
  memory segments (see <a href="shmget.html">shmget</a>) that may be
  locked by the real user ID of the calling process.
  The <a href="shmctl.html">shmctl</a> SHM_LOCK locks are accounted
  for separately from the per-process memory locks established
  by <a href="mlock.html">mlock</a>, <a href="mlockall.html">mlockall</a>,
  and <a href="mmap.html">mmap</a> MAP_LOCKED; a process can lock
  bytes up to this limit in each of these two categories.  In Linux
  kernels before 2.6.9, this limit controlled the amount of memory
  that could be locked by a privileged process.  Since Linux 2.6.9, no
  limits are placed on the amount of memory that a privileged process
  may lock, and this limit instead governs the amount of memory that
  an unprivileged process may lock.
