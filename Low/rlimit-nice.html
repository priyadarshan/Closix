<P>
  Specifies a ceiling to which the process's nice value can be raised
  using <a href="setpriority.html">setpriority</a>
  or <a href="nice..html">nice</a>.  The actual ceiling for the nice
  value is calculated as 20 - rlim_cur.  (This strangeness occurs
  because negative numbers cannot be specified as resource limit
  values, since they typically have special meanings.  For example,
  RLIM_INFINITY typically is the same as -1.)
