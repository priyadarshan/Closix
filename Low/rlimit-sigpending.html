  Specifies the limit on the number of signals that may be queued for
  the real user ID of the calling process.  Both standard and
  real-time signals are counted for the purpose of checking this
  limit.  However, the limit is only enforced for sigqueue(3); it is
  always possible to use <a href="kill.html">kill</a> to queue one
  instance of any of the signals that are not already queued to the
  process.
