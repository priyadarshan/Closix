<P>
  Used in <a href="lseek.html">lseek</a> to indicate that
  the <i>offset</i> argument should be interpreted to mean that the
  file offset should be adjusted to the next hole in the file greater
  than or equal to offset.  If offset points into the middle of a
  hole, then the file offset is set to offset. If there is no hole
  past offset, then the file offset is adjusted to the end of the file
  (i.e., there is an implicit hole at the end of any file).
