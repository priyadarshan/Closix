  <P>
    The API comes in two levels:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	<P>
	  A low-level interface with emphasis on performance.
	</P>
	<P>
	  This interface may not be extremely convenient to use, but
	  it has minimal overhead for applications that require
	  maximum performance.
	</P>
	<P>
	  Functions at this level take a constant number of arguments
	  so as to avoid the overhead of
	  processing <TT>&amp;optional</TT> or <TT>&amp;key</TT>
	  arguments.
	</P>
	<P>
	  Errors at this level are indicated by additional return
	  values in the form of small numbers.  Constant variables are
	  supplied to allow easy comparison for error values. 
	</P>
      </LI>
      <LI>
	<P>
	  A high-level interface with emphasis on convenience.
	</P>
	<P>
	  This interface may require some overhead in order to make
	  use more convenient to the programmer.
	</P>
	<P>
	  Functions at this level may take optional or keyword
	  arguments for convenience.  
	</P>
	<P>
	  Errors at this level are indicated by some condition being
	  signaled.  When appropriate, restarts are provided. 
	</P>
      </LI>
    </UL>
