<H1>POSIX system-call API for Common Lisp</H1>

<p>
  These pages represent an ongoing project to define a Common Lisp API
  for POSIX system calls. 
</p>

<P>
  The goal of the API is to provide a convenient interface to POSIX
  system calls, while still providing some optimizations such as
  allowing the caller to supply pre-allocated objects for the call to
  fill in. 
</P>

<P>
  We are aware of projects such as Ossicat.  The goal of this project
  is quite different.  We are mainly interested in creating
  a <i>specification</i> of an API that looks "natural" to Common
  Lisp.  This requirement excludes the use of any foreign-function
  interface (FFI) if using such an interface makes the underlying
  lower-level programming language visible in the interface.  It is of
  course not excluded to use some FFI to implement the various
  functions of this interface, but the mapping may not direct for all
  functions.
</P>

<P>
  Since there is no direct correspondence between the functions in
  this interface and similar functions in (say) libc, the
  specification of this interface must be complete and without
  reference to such similar functions.
</P>

<P>
  The API comes in two levels:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      <P>
	A low-level interface with emphasis on performance.
      </P>
      <P>
	This interface may not be extremely convenient to use, but
	it has minimal overhead for applications that require
	maximum performance.
      </P>
      <P>
	Functions at this level take a constant number of arguments
	so as to avoid the overhead of
	processing <TT>&amp;optional</TT> or <TT>&amp;key</TT>
	arguments.
      </P>
      <P>
	Errors at this level are indicated by additional return
	values in the form of small numbers.  Constant variables are
	supplied to allow easy comparison for error values. 
      </P>
    </LI>
    <LI>
      <P>
	A high-level interface with emphasis on convenience.
      </P>
      <P>
	This interface may require some overhead in order to make
	use more convenient to the programmer.
      </P>
      <P>
	Functions at this level may take optional or keyword
	arguments for convenience.  
      </P>
      <P>
	Errors at this level are indicated by some condition being
	signaled.  When appropriate, restarts are provided. 
      </P>
      <P>
	Functionality at this level is implemented in terms of the
	low-level interface.
      </P>
    </LI>
  </UL>
</P>
