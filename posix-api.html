<H1>POSIX system-call API for Common Lisp</H1>

<p>
These pages represent an ongoing project to define a Common Lisp API
for POSIX system calls. 
</p>

<p>
The goal of the API is to provide a convenient interface to POSIX
system calls, while still providing some optimizations such as
allowing the caller to supply pre-allocated objects for the call to
fill in.
