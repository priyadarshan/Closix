<H1>POSIX system-call API for Common Lisp</H1>

<p>
  These pages represent an ongoing project to define a Common Lisp API
  for invoking system calls on Unix-like systems.  This API is
  inspired by POSIX.
</p>

<P>
  The POSIX standard defines an API for invoking system calls on
  Unix-like systems.  The specification is given as a collection of
  functions in the C language with associated descriptions of the
  number and types of the arguments, return values, and error
  codes.
</P>

<P>
  The goal of this project is to define an API for invoking such
  system calls from Common Lisp, without referring to the C language
  interface.  It can be thought of as an alternative to POSIX for
  Common Lisp programmers.
</P>

<P>
  We are aware of projects such as Ossicat.  The goal of this project
  is quite different.  We are mainly interested in creating
  a <i>specification</i> of an API that looks "natural" to Common
  Lisp.  This requirement excludes the use of any foreign-function
  interface (FFI) if using such an interface makes the underlying
  lower-level programming language visible in the interface.  It is of
  course not excluded to use some FFI to implement the various
  functions of this interface, but the mapping may not be direct for
  all functions.
</P>

<P>
  Since there is no direct correspondence between the functions in
  this interface and similar functions in (say) libc, the
  specification of this interface must be complete and without
  reference to such similar functions.
</P>

<P>
  The API comes in two levels:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      <P>
	A low-level interface with emphasis on performance.
      </P>
      <P>
	This interface may not be extremely convenient to use, but
	it has minimal overhead for applications that require
	maximum performance.
      </P>
      <P>
	Functions at this level take a constant number of arguments
	so as to avoid the overhead of
	processing <TT>&amp;optional</TT> or <TT>&amp;key</TT>
	arguments.
      </P>
      <P>
	Errors at this level are indicated by additional return
	values in the form of small numbers.  Constant variables are
	supplied to allow easy comparison for error values. 
      </P>
      <P>
	When the corresponding POSIX system call requires a C-language
	structure instance, the corresponding Common Lisp function
	accepts an instance of subclass of STANDARD-OBJECT.
      </P>
    </LI>
    <LI>
      <P>
	A high-level interface with emphasis on convenience.
      </P>
      <P>
	This interface may require some overhead in order to make
	use more convenient to the programmer.
      </P>
      <P>
	Functions at this level may take optional or keyword
	arguments for convenience.  
      </P>
      <P>
	Errors at this level are indicated by some condition being
	signaled.  When appropriate, restarts are provided. 
      </P>
      <P>
	Functionality at this level is implemented in terms of the
	low-level interface.
      </P>
      <P>
	When the corresponding POSIX system call requires a C-language
	structure instance, when practical, the corresponding Common
	Lisp function accepts an <i>optional</i> instance of subclass
	of STANDARD-OBJECT.  If this instance is not supplied, one
	will be allocated.
      </P>
    </LI>
  </UL>
