<P>
  The maximum size of files that the process may create.  Attempts to
  extend a file beyond this limit result in delivery of a SIGXFSZ
  signal.  By default, this signal terminates a process, but a process
  can catch this signal instead, in which case the relevant system call
  (e.g. <a href="low-write.html">write</a>, <a href="low-truncate.html">truncate</a>)
  fails with the error <a href="efbig.html">+efbig+</a>.
