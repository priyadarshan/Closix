  Specifies a value one greater than the maximum file descriptor
  number that can be opened by this process.  Attempts
  (<a href="open.html">open</a>,
  <a href="pipe.html">pipe</a>, <a href="dup.html">dup</a>, etc.)  to
  exceed this limit yield the
  error <a href="emfile.html">+emfile+</a>.  (Historically, this limit
  was named RLIMIT_OFILE on BSD.)
