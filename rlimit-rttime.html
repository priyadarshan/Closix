<P>
  Specifies a limit (in microseconds) on the amount of CPU time that a
  process scheduled under a real-time scheduling policy may consume
  without making a blocking system call.  For the purpose of this
  limit, each time a process makes a blocking system call, the count
  of its consumed CPU time is reset to zero.  The CPU time count is
  not reset if the process continues trying to use the CPU but is
  preempted, its time slice expires, or it
  calls <a href="sched-yield.html">sched-yield</a>
</P>

<P>
  Upon reaching the soft limit, the process is sent a SIGXCPU signal.
  If the process catches or ignores this signal and continues
  consuming CPU time, then SIGXCPU will be generated once each second
  until the hard limit is reached, at which point the process is sent
  a SIGKILL signal.
</P>

<P>
  The intended use of this limit is to stop a runaway real-time
  process from locking up the system.
